This is weather app which helps to find the weather condition with latitude, longitude, humidity, wind-speed just by entering the city name.
This was done as a front-end project with react.js
I have used OpenWeather api calls for the current city weather conditions.
Use the api key generated by OpenWeather website for the current weather api calls.
